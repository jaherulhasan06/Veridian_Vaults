# Veridian Vaults - A Decentralized Time Capsule Protocol

## Project Description
Veridian Vaults is a smart contract that enables users to create encrypted, time-locked vaults of information. The contents of each vault remain inaccessible until a specified future timestamp, offering a secure and novel way to send secrets to the future.

## Project Vision
To allow the transfer and storage of encrypted data that can only be accessed by its rightful owner after a defined time, promoting innovation in digital inheritance, collectibles, and future-gifting.

## Key Features
- Encrypted data vaults with time-based access control
- Vault ownership and access restricted to creator
- Event-based architecture for vault creation and unlocking

## Future Scope
- NFT-based access rights
- Chainlink Automation for timed execution
- Decentralized file storage (e.g., IPFS)
- Vault trading and speculation marketplace
